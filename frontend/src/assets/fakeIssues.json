No columns are listed as primary keys (though we do have them) and foreign keys are never linked. So I'm actually kinda used to things not being linked if you want to leave it as un-linked.

So I'll need to get a list of accounts for them to choose from for that as well.\nDepending on how you set up the 'create issue' API, I'd also need to lookup their account_ID in order to submit the new issue.\nI'm assuming the API to get the issue will only return a worker ID, so I'll need to pull a list of accounts in order to get the username associated with the ID. Alternatively you could change what the API Pulls to something like the query that I'll put below this (I'm used to writing SQL in BigQuery, so my syntax may be wrong for MySQL but it'll be similar). However like I said that is something I can do on the frontend if you'd rather.\nAnother thing to consider is we would want this to be restricted to only be available to internal use. Don't want a user doing a postman get request to receive all Users. Though if I'm being honest idk how to restrict it like that so maybe we just keep that part hush hush?\nSELECT\n\ta.issue_id,\n\ta.description,\n\ta.priority,\n\ta.severity,\n\ta.status,\n\ta.summary,\n\tb.username AS reporter,\n\tc.username AS worker\nFROM issue a\n\tLEFT JOIN account b ON a.reporter_id = b.account_key\n\tLEFT JOIN account c ON a.worker_id = c.account_key\n;",
